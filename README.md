### To-Do-App
Classic todo-app created with React.

* There is a form input where the user can add a new todo.
* On first load the list of todos is empty.
* When the user submits a new todo from the form the todo card appears in the list.
* Each todo card is toggleable between 'done' and 'not done'.
* There is a remove-button on cards that are 'done' and when the user clicks the button it will be removed from the list.
* Todo cards which are set to 'done' appear on the bottom of the list, and are easy to visually separate from the others.
* The original order of the cards is maintained if you toggle a card to 'not done' and then back again.
* It is easy to add, toggle and remove todo's. For example adding a new card by hitting 'enter'.

### Technical specifications
* The todo-list is kept in a state object.
* The app uses 3 levels of class- and functional components.
* Props are used for passing necessary information to components.
* The app is not using use React Router, Hooks nor Redux.
